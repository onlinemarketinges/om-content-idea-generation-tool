## Technical Details

### Architecture

The Viral Content Ideas Generator consists of:

1. **Data Collection Modules**: Python scripts for collecting data from social media platforms
2. **Viral Identification Algorithm**: Identifies videos that perform significantly better than average
3. **SQLite Database**: Stores video data, profile information, and daily top videos
4. **Web Server**: Serves the web interface and API endpoints
5. **Frontend Interface**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for user interaction

### Database Schema

The database contains three main tables:
- `profiles`: Stores information about social media profiles
- `videos`: Stores information about individual videos
- `daily_top_videos`: Links videos to specific dates for historical browsing

### API Endpoints

The tool provides two main API endpoints:
- `/api/videos?day_offset=0&platform=all`: Get videos for a specific day and platform
- `/api/dates`: Get a list of available dates with data

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No videos displayed**: 
   - Check if the data collection process ran successfully
   - Verify that the database file exists in the data directory
   - Check server logs for errors

2. **Cannot access the tool**:
   - Verify the server is running with `ps aux | grep server.py`
   - Check if the correct port is being used (default: 8000)
   - Ensure firewall settings allow access to the port

3. **Videos not embedding properly**:
   - Ensure your browser allows embedded content
   - Check internet connection to the video platforms

### Logs

Log files are stored in the `data` directory:
- `automation.log`: Contains logs from the automated data collection process
